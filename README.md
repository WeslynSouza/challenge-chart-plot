# Challenge chart plot

The project was created using the React framework, due to its easy processing and presentation of data, which are always updated quickly and dynamically.

The project has 1 page that is composed of 4 components, namely: header, inputText, chart and footer.

The application is currently being hosted on the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) platform to facilitate access. This platform not only enables the host of the application but also provides scripts for CI.

## Libraries:

In addition to the basic functionalities of React, some libraries were also used to implement the functionality of the application, namely:

[React-CodeMirror](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-codemirror/): Library used to create a data input with the formatting of a JS IDE.

[Nivo](https://nivo.rocks): Library used to create the graph used in the application, allowing the creation of a graph in lines along with a list of the items present in the graph.
